# Lucas Meme Generator!

This repo is a snapshot/run through of a tech talk I'm giving at Columbia on 3/5/14. It's by no means an exhausted intro to Android, but it should be a good glimpse of lots of the framework's components and how to get started with Android dev.

Each commit represents a unit of the development - feel free to check them out individually to see how everything comes together.

## Dependencies

This was developed using Android Studio. You can also use Eclipse/ant or Intellij/maven if you'd like, but some files/directory hierarchies might be slightly different. Android Studio is still in beta, but it's really great - I'd recommend giving it a whirl.

* Download Android Studio here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html
* If you don't have an Android phone or just want to have an emulator on your computer, I'd recommend downloading Genymotion (http://www.genymotion.com/). You can create a free account and download a VM (make sure you have Virtualbox too - https://www.virtualbox.org/) - it should be significantly faster than regular Android Virtual Devices provided by Google.
